		*** HUNT THE WUMPUS README ***

	** DESCRIPTION **

Hello everyone !

This is my (real) first game which started as a programming exercice from "Programming - Principle and Practice using C++" by Stroustrup.
The only thing original about this game is that it was designed as an implementation of an Entity-Component-System, as described here : http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/rdbms-with-code-in-systems .
This was a really fun exercice which taught me quite a lot about programming in general and how important it is to plan before doing any coding (yeah, it's a rookie mistake, as it results a lot of spaghetti code).
I hope you'll enjoy playing this game and browsing through my code, as I provide with a WTFPL licence.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!

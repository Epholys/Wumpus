You are a brave adventurer who must slay for the villagers the terrible and smelly Wumpus.
In exchange of a handful of gold coins, of course.
But as soon as you enter the cavern, the smell is so strong that you lose consciousness.
You wake up some hours later, your torch extinguished, by the sound of naked wings : a giant bat has taken you for its dinner!
You knock off the monster with your bare hands and fell together into the solid ground.
-----
You are now completely lost, in the dark, with for only weapon your bow and 10 arrows, and must annihilate the Wumpus.
But beware! Numerous traps are hidden in this cave, and maybe this giant bat wasn't the only one...
